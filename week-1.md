# Learning the basics of Vim

## The Vim modes

### Normal mode

- This is the mode that we start in
- Allows us to move around inside the file
- k is to move up
- j is to move down
- h is to move left
- l is to move right
- w is to move to the next word
- b is to move to the previous word
- with relative line numbers enabled, we can move to a line by typing the number of lines to move
- d is to delete words or lines
  - we can delete a word by typing dw
  - we can delete a line by typing dd
  - we can delete backwards by typing db
- x deletes the character under the cursor

### Insert mode

- lets us type things inside the file
- a enters insert mode after the cursor

### Visual mode

- kind of like holding down left mouse in other text editors
- shift + v enters visual line mode
- we can also highlight with relative line numbers enabled

### Command-line mode

- lets us run commands
- ex:
  - :q to quit
  - :w to save
